# How to Run My Portfolio Site Locally

# Step 1: Install `serve` to Host My Webpage Locally

To run My portfolio site on your local machine, I need to install `serve`. You can do this globally with npm by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install -g serve


This will install `serve` globally, making it available to host My site.

# Step 2: Navigate to Your Project Directory


Use the command prompt to navigate to the directory where My portfolio project is located. Replace the path below with the path to your project directory:


cd C:\Users\91709\Desktop\Intern Mini\Abishek Portfolio


# Step 3: Start the Local Server
To start serving My portfolio site, simply run the `serve` command:

"serve"

This will start a local server, and you will see the local and network addresses where My site is being served.

# Step 4: Access My Site in the Browser
Once the server is running, you can access My site by opening the local address in your web browser:

- **Local Address:** [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Network Address:** [http://172.28.224.1:3000](http://172.28.224.1:3000) (optional)

### Step 5: Stop the Server
To stop the server, go back to the terminal where the server is running and press `CTRL + C`.

You should see a message indicating that the server is shutting down:


INFO  Gracefully shutting down. Please wait...


That's it! My portfolio site should now be up and running on your local machine.

These are the Steps to Host My Portfolio Project in My Local Machine using the Serve.
